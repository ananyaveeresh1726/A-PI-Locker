# A-PI-Locker
A-Pi Locker is a secure record/password manager with the help of raspberry pi zero which act as a server device to store and access the encrypted information from the client device. I am using  RESTful API to transfer the encrypted information from the server to client and vice versa. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communication protocol—and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used. In server side I will use ReSTful API which is written in Google’s Go language which reads  and writes the encrypted record/password on SQLite databases. On the client side I run on HTML5 and JavaScript and it encrypts and decrypts the password/records using the CryptoJS for AES encryption and PRNG. Also I will be modifying the configuration of Raspberry Pi Zero to enable ethernet connectivity over its USB port . It will create a new network interface when connected to the client (like other computers or smartphones) and we can connect with the server through any browser that supports HTML5.
